OpenGL is a long-lasting 3D graphics standard that powers the majority of games and graphical applications; [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) is a JavaScript API that allows us to use OpenGL inside a web browser environment. At the end of this tutorial we'll have code to render a triangle; this on its own will take a good amount of setup, but from there it doesn't take much more work to build more advanced things.

To get started, populate an `index.html` file with the following:

~~~ html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0px;
        position: fixed;
        background-color: #000;
      }
      html, body {
        overflow: hidden;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
      canvas {
        position: absolute;
      }
    </style>
    <title>WebGL Intro</title>
  </head>
  <body onload="setup();">
    <canvas id="glCanvas" width="100px;" height="100px;"></canvas>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

This gives us an HTML5 `<canvas>` to display our WebGL content with. With the help of the embedded CSS, our canvas will fill the entire page; a little JavaScript will address this later as the canvas cannot be scaled directly through HTML attributes.

In our `main.js` we need to implement some initial setup. To do anything with WebGL, we need to get a WebGL context associated with our canvas:

~~~ js
// store both of these for later use
var canvas;
var gl;
var program;
var attrPosition;
var attrColor;
var unfmScale;
var unfmAspect;
var triangleBuffer;

function setup() {
  canvas = document.getElementById("glCanvas");
  gl = canvas.getContext("experimental-webgl", {antialias: true});

  gl.clearColor(.05, .23, .3, 1); // set the background color to clear with
}
~~~

We need some way of defining our triangle to WebGL; we need to represent it as a (flat) array of 2D coordinates. We'll make an equilateral triangle:

~~~ js
var triangleMesh = [
  // first point, x = -1, y = -.866
  -1, -.866,
  // second point, x = 1, y = -.866
  1, -.866,
  // and so on
  0, 1,
];
~~~

OpenGL / WebGL has 'buffer' objects that allow us to store data on the graphics card for rendering; in our `setup()` we'll create a buffer and upload our mesh to it:

~~~ js
// create a buffer on the GPU and upload the triangle mesh to it
triangleBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, triangleBuffer);
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(triangleMesh), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
~~~
