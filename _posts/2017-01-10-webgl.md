OpenGL is a long-lasting 3D graphics standard that powers the majority of games and graphical applications; [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) is a JavaScript API that allows us to use OpenGL inside a web browser environment. At the end of this tutorial we'll have code to render a triangle; on its own this will take a good amount of setup, but from there it doesn't take much more work to build more advanced things. Keep in mind that throughout this tutorial we'll pass over some chunks of code without going into too much detail about what's going on; OpenGL is a large API that's difficult to cover in detail in any single tutorial.

Populate an `index.html` file with the following:

~~~ html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0px;
        position: fixed;
        background-color: #000;
      }
      html, body {
        overflow: hidden;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
      canvas {
        position: absolute;
      }
    </style>
    <title>WebGL Intro</title>
  </head>
  <body onload="setup();">
    <canvas id="glCanvas" width="100px;" height="100px;"></canvas>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

This gives us an HTML5 `<canvas>` to display our WebGL content with. With the help of the embedded CSS, our canvas will fill the entire page; a little JavaScript will address this later as the canvas cannot be scaled directly through HTML attributes.

In our `main.js` we need to implement some initial setup. To do anything with WebGL, we need to get a WebGL context associated with our canvas:

~~~ js
var canvas;
var gl;
var program;
var attrPosition;
var attrColor; // used later
var unfmScale;
var unfmAspect;
var triangleBuffer;

function setup() {
  canvas = document.getElementById("glCanvas");
  gl = canvas.getContext("experimental-webgl", {antialias: true});

  gl.clearColor(.05, .23, .3, 1); // set the background color to clear with
}
~~~

We need some way of defining our triangle to WebGL; in this case we'll represent it as a (flat) array of 2D coordinates that define the three points of the triangle. We'll make an equilateral triangle:

~~~ js
var triangleMesh = [
  // first point, x = -1, y = -.866
  -1, -.866,
  // second point, x = 1, y = -.866
  1, -.866,
  // and so on
  0, 1,
];
~~~

OpenGL / WebGL has 'buffer' objects that allow us to store data on the graphics card for rendering; in our `setup()` we'll create a buffer and upload our mesh to it:

~~~ js
// create a buffer on the GPU and upload the triangle mesh to it
triangleBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, triangleBuffer);
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(triangleMesh), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
~~~

In modern graphics frameworks, 'shaders' are written to process data; now that we have our vertex data loaded into OpenGL, we need to write a vertex shader and a fragment shader to process it. First, our vertex shader:

~~~ js
var glslVertexSource = `
uniform float scale;
uniform float aspect;
attribute vec2 position;

void main() {
  gl_Position = vec4(position.x / scale / aspect, position.y / scale, 0.5, 1.0);
}
`;
~~~

And our fragment shader:

~~~ js
var glslFragmentSource = `
precision mediump float;

void main() {
  gl_FragColor = vec4(0.8, 0.5, 0.4, 1.0);
}
`;
~~~

We now need to compile these into a GLSL 'program' that we can draw with:

~~~ js
function createShader(source, type) {
  var shader = gl.createShader(type);
  gl.shaderSource(shader, source);
  gl.compileShader(shader);

  // report any errors from compiling the shader
  if(!gl.getShaderParameter(shader, gl.COMPILE_STATUS)) {
    alert("error compiling " + (type == gl.VERTEX_SHADER ? "vertex" : "fragment") + " shader: " + gl.getShaderInfoLog(shader));
  }

  return shader;
}

function createProgram(vertexSource, fragmentSource) {
  var program = gl.createProgram();
  var vertexShader = createShader(vertexSource, gl.VERTEX_SHADER);
  var fragmentShader = createShader(fragmentSource, gl.FRAGMENT_SHADER);
  gl.attachShader(program, vertexShader);
  gl.attachShader(program, fragmentShader);
  gl.linkProgram(program);
  return program;
}
~~~

Now we can compile our GLSL and use the shader program. We have a couple variables that we want to be able to access through our JavaScript; we'll want to get their IDs (locations) so that we can access them:

~~~ js
program = createProgram(glslVertexSource, glslFragmentSource);
unfmScale = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "scale");
unfmAspect = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "aspect");
attrPosition = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "position");

gl.enableVertexAttribArray(attrPosition);

gl.useProgram(program);

gl.uniform1f(unfmScale, 2.1); // set the 'scale' uniform to a custom value

draw(); // implemented later
~~~

Now we're actually able to draw!

~~~ js
function draw() {
  canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
  canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

  // set the aspect ratio
  gl.uniform1f(unfmAspect, canvas.width / canvas.height);

  // draw to the whole canvas and clear to the background color
  gl.viewport(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

  gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, triangleBuffer);
  gl.vertexAttribPointer(attrPosition, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 4 * 2, 0);
  gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 3);

  gl.flush();
  window.requestAnimationFrame(draw);
}
~~~

This might look a little foreign so we'll walk through it step by step.

As mentioned earlier, we need to resize the canvas to fit the window:

~~~ js
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
~~~

Send the aspect ratio (window width / window height) to our shader:

~~~ js
gl.uniform1f(unfmAspect, canvas.width / canvas.height);
~~~

Set OpenGL's viewport to the whole canvas and fill it with the clear color:

~~~ js
gl.viewport(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
~~~

Here we finally render our triangle:

~~~ js
// use our triangle buffer as the active buffer
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, triangleBuffer);
// tell our vertex shader how to get the position from our data, more on this later
gl.vertexAttribPointer(attrPosition, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 4 * 2, 0);
// draw a triangle with the first three vertices
gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
~~~

After we tell OpenGL to draw, we need to push the drawn frame to our `<canvas>` and run the draw function again next frame:

~~~ js
gl.flush();
window.requestAnimationFrame(draw);
~~~

Hopefully at this point you should be able to open your `index.html` and see this:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/webgl-tri-1.png" style="border:none; width: 100%;">

If not, you can always refer to the sample code on this tutorial's [repository](https://github.com/lnpalmer/webgl-intro).

Now that we have a working base example, let's add some more color to the scene. Previously our vertices had two numbers associated with each of them, an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. Let's add a color to each vertex by adding a red, green, and blue value:

~~~ js
var triangleMesh = [
  // x, y, r(ed), g(reen), b(lue)
  -1, -.866, .2, .6, 1,
  1, -.866, .6, 1, .2,
  0, 1, 1, .2, .6
];
~~~

We can modify our shader to use this color value for each vertex and blend smoothly between the three colors for each point of the triangle. We do this by declaring a variable with the `varying` keyword:

~~~ js
var glslVertexSource = `
uniform float scale;
uniform float aspect;
attribute vec2 position;
attribute vec3 color;
varying vec3 _color;

void main() {
  gl_Position = vec4(position.x / scale / aspect, position.y / scale, 0.5, 1.0);
  _color = color;
}
`;

var glslFragmentSource = `
precision mediump float;
varying vec3 _color;

void main() {
  gl_FragColor = vec4(0.8, 0.5, 0.4, 1.0);
}
`;
~~~

`varying` allows us to pass discrete values for each vertex in the vertex shader, and then send that data to the fragment shader to interpolate smooth values for each pixel.

We also need to explain the new vertex structure to OpenGL when we draw:

~~~ js
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, triangleBuffer);
// vertices are (2 + 3) values, the first 2 are the position
gl.vertexAttribPointer(attrPosition, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 4 * (2 + 3), 0);
// vertices are (2 + 3) values, the 3 after the first 2 are the color
gl.vertexAttribPointer(attrColor, 3, gl.FLOAT, false, 4 * (2 + 3), 4 * 2);
gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
~~~

Back in our `setup()` we need to add some extra calls:

~~~ js
void setup() {

  // ...

  attrPosition = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "position");
  attrColor = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "color");

  gl.enableVertexAttribArray(attrPosition);
  gl.enableVertexAttribArray(attrColor);

  // ...

}
~~~

That's it! The fragment shader should now take the colors of the triangle's vertices and blend them to color each pixel. Here's what it (hopefully!) looks like:
