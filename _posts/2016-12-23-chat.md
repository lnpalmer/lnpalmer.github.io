[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is an incredible JavaScript library for high-performance networking; by running it on node.js as a server, and in a web browser as a client, we can easily create a 'chat' application that allows for communication between several users.

To get started, install [node](https://nodejs.org) on your machine and get the `socket.io` package:

```shell
$ npm install socket.io
```

You'll also want to install `express` for serving web pages:

```shell
$ npm install express
```

Sample foo code

```c++
// adjust the weights based on their gradients. uses RMSprop for learning rate adjustment
void NVector::learn(float learningRate) {
	size_t localSize = 16;
	size_t globalSize = ceil(numNeurons / (float)localSize) * localSize;
	for (int i = 0; i < connections.size(); i++) {
		clSetKernelArg(RNN::learnKernel, 0, sizeof(cl_mem), &weightsMem[i]);
		clSetKernelArg(RNN::learnKernel, 1, sizeof(cl_mem), &weightDerivativesMem[i]);
		clSetKernelArg(RNN::learnKernel, 2, sizeof(cl_mem), &rmsesMem[i]);
		clSetKernelArg(RNN::learnKernel, 3, sizeof(int), &numNeurons);
		clSetKernelArg(RNN::learnKernel, 4, sizeof(int), &(connections[i]->numNeurons));
		clSetKernelArg(RNN::learnKernel, 5, sizeof(float), &learningRate);
		clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(RNN::clQueue, RNN::learnKernel, 1, NULL, &globalSize, &localSize, 0, NULL, NULL);
		clFinish(RNN::clQueue);
	}
}
```
