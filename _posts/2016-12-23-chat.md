[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is an incredible JavaScript library for high-performance networking; by running it on node.js as a server, and in a web browser as a client, we can easily create a 'chat' application that allows for communication between several users.

To get started, install [node](https://nodejs.org) on your machine and get the `socket.io` package:

    > npm install socket.io

You'll also want to install `express` for serving web pages:

    > npm install express

Sample JavaScript foo text:

```python
a = r1.step(x)
b = r2.step(y)
```
