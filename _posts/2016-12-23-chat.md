[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is an incredible JavaScript library for high-performance networking; by running it on node.js as a server, and in a web browser as a client, we can easily create a 'chat' application that allows for communication between several users.

To get started, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) on your machine and get the `socket.io` package. By default, node installs packages to your working directory, so make sure that you're in your project folder:

``` sh
$ npm install socket.io
```

You'll also want to install `express` for serving web pages:

``` sh
$ npm install express
```

We're going to use express to set up a small HTTP server, and use it to serve a single webpage which'll act as a frontend to our chat room. Some initial setup in our `server.js`:

``` js
var express = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(express);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
```

Express allows us to set the response to HTTP GET requests for various pages. We'll send a client HTML file for the root page, and provide a JavaScript file client.js to go along with it:

``` js
express.get('/', function(request, result) {
  result.sendFile(__dirname + '/client.html');
});
express.get('/client.js', function(request, result) {
  result.sendFile(__dirname + '/client.js');
});
```

We'll create these files later. For now, open the HTTP server on port 4444:

``` js
http.listen('4444', function() {
  console.log('listening for requests...');
});
```

Like just about everything in node, socket.io uses an event-based model to drive interaction. `io.on()` takes an event name as its first argument; the 'connection' event is fired when a socket.io client first connects to the server. The handler receives a socket object to represent the connection:

~~~ js
io.on('connection', function(socket) {
  // do something with the socket...
});
~~~

`socket.on()` will run a function every time the server receives an event from the client that socket represents. We can name events whatever we like; we'll have the socket receive 'chat' messages and echo them back to all the connected clients:

~~~ js
io.on('connection', function(socket) {
  socket.on('chat', function(message) {
    console.log('message received, content: ' + message);
    io.emit('chat', message);
  });
});
~~~

Now we need to shift to the client side. We'll use this for our `client.html`:

~~~ html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-y3tfxAZXuh4HwSYylfB+J125MxIs6mR5FOHamPBG064zB+AFeWH94NdvaCBm8qnd" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <title>chat room</title>
  </head>
  <body onload="setup();">
    <div class="container">
      <br />
      <h2>socket.io chat room</h2>
      <hr />
      <div id="chatContent"></div>
      <hr />
      <input id="messageInput" type="text"></input>
      <button onclick="send();">Send</button>
      <script src="client.js"></script>
      <script src="https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.4.5.js"></script>
      <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.2/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-vZ2WRJMwsjRMW/8U7i6PWi6AlO1L79snBrmgiDpgIWJ82z8eA5lenwvxbMV1PAh7" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used here for cleanliness and mobile support. In `client.js`, set up the socket.io client once the page loads:

~~~ js
function setup() {
  socket = io(); // load the socket.io client

  // called when a 'chat' event is received, add a <p> with the message to the chat div
  socket.on('chat', function(message) {
    document.getElementById('chatContent').innerHTML += '<p>' + message + '</p>';
  });
}
~~~

`socket.emit()` sends a message to the server so that it can be relayed to other clients. When the user clicks the send button:

~~~ js
function send() {
  socket.emit('chat', document.getElementById('messageInput').value);
  document.getElementById('messageInput').value = '';
}
~~~

At this point our setup is bordering complete. Start the server:

~~~ sh
$ node server
~~~

At this point, you should be able to point your web browser to `localhost:4444` and get something that resembles this:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/socket-io-chat-web.png" style="border:none; width: 100%;">

Our application is almost complete; you should be able to send messages and receive them on connected clients. You'll notice that there isn't any identifier showing what messages are from what users; we need to supply more information than just a message to the server when a user clicks send. Get a username string upon startup:

~~~ js
var username = window.prompt('Enter a username:', '');
~~~

Socket.io allows us to pass an arbitrary number of parameters of just about any type as a message; in our `send()` add in a second additional parameter after the event type:

~~~ js
socket.emit('chat', document.getElementById('messageInput').value, username);
~~~

In our `server.js`, receiving this second bit of data is as easy as adding a second parameter to the callback in `socket.on()`:

~~~ js
socket.on('chat', function(message, username) {
  console.log('message received, sent by: ' + username + ', content: ' + message);
  io.emit('chat', message, username);
});
~~~

This second parameter is emitted back to `client.js`, where we also need to receive the username parameter:

~~~ js
// italicize usernames in chat, distinguish your own username with <b>
var format = 'i';
if(author == username) format = 'b';

document.getElementById('chatContent').innerHTML += '<p><' + format + '>' + author + '</' + format + '> | ' + message + '</p>';
~~~
