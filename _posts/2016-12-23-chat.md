[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is an incredible JavaScript library for high-performance networking; by running it on node.js as a server, and in a web browser as a client, we can easily create a 'chat' application that allows for communication between several users.

To get started, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) on your machine and get the `socket.io` package. By default, node installs packages to your working directory, so make sure that you're in your project folder:

``` shell
$ npm install socket.io
```

You'll also want to install `express` for serving web pages:

``` shell
$ npm install express
```

We're going to use express to set up a small HTTP server, and use it to serve a single webpage which'll act as a frontend to our chat room. Some initial setup:

``` js
var express = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(express);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
```

Express allows us to set the response to HTTP GET requests for various pages. We'll send a client HTML file for the root page, and provide a JavaScript file `client.js` to go along with it:

``` JavaScript
express.get('/', function(request, result) {
  result.sendFile(__dirname + '/client.html');
});
express.get('/client.js', function(request, result) {
  result.sendFile(__dirname + '/client.js');
});
```

Open the HTTP server on port 4444:

``` javascript
http.listen('4444', function() {
  console.log('listening for requests...');
});
```
