[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is an incredible JavaScript library for high-performance networking; by running it on node.js as a server, and in a web browser as a client, we can easily create a 'chat' application that allows for communication between several users.

To get started, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) on your machine and get the `socket.io` package. By default, node installs packages to your working directory, so make sure that you're in your project folder:

``` shell
$ npm install socket.io
```

You'll also want to install `express` for serving web pages:

``` shell
$ npm install express
```

Some initial setup for our server:

``` js
var express = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(express);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
```
