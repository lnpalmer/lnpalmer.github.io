[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is an incredible JavaScript library for high-performance networking; by running it on node.js as a server, and in a web browser as a client, we can easily create a 'chat' application that allows for communication between several users.

To get started, install a copy of [node](https://nodejs.org) on your machine and install the socket.io package:

    npm install socket.io
