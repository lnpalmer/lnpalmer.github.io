[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is an incredible JavaScript library for high-performance networking; by running it on node.js as a server, and in a web browser as a client, we can easily create a 'chat' application that allows for communication between several users.

To get started, install [node](https://nodejs.org) on your machine and get the `socket.io` package:

    > npm install socket.io

You'll also want to install `express` for serving web pages:

    > npm install express

Sample python text, kramdown please work

```python
class RNN:
  # ...
  def step(self, x):
    # update the hidden state
    self.h = np.tanh(np.dot(self.W_hh, self.h) + np.dot(self.W_xh, x))
    # compute the output vector
    y = np.dot(self.W_hy, self.h)
    return y
```
